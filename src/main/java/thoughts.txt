Need to first assign drivers to each vehicle
in order to drive a truck, need to have a cdl
so we should make a method to have qualified drivers for the specified vehicle
we can then check to find the most senior driver with a valid license, they will have first priority
then for the amount of requested cars, we can find everyone who is qualified to drive the current car
then we should assign someone to the car based on who was hired first
